### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The main purpose of my GitHub account is a code storage location for personal proof of concept work as a hobby workspace. In my day-to-day work I am leading the technical roadmap, architecture and team of a global enterprise product.

My technology expertise is towards Microsoft technology tech stack (C#, .NET Core, Azure Functions, Azure Web App, Azure Service Bus, Azure Redis Cache, Azure KeyVault, Azure DevOps, Azure Application Insight, Azure Search, Office 365 automation and many more) but also scripting languages as Python (creating tools for monitoring and CI/CD) and YAML (Azure DevOps pipelines). The proof of concept work is primairly hobby code which falls.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on publishing ESP32 material on my GitHub account
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ by programming an ESP32 as it is outside my comfort zone and hoping to start soon on Rust development on the ESP32
